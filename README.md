# toolkit
Multi-tool scripts for modular use in work.

Aiming for flexibility and ease of use enough for similarly positioned business/accountancy professionals like me with basic knowledge of Programming.

##Current works

#General purpose:

mcb.py: Saves, loads and deletes pieces of text to the clipboard.

multireader.py: reads pdf, docx, xlsx and any other files, outputs successful reads into datastructure in the form of a dictionary, unsuccessful reads in a seperate list.

writemodules.py: writing modules multitool, writes datastructure into txt, csv or into excel, also allows file-directory organization.

inputsql.py: Interfaces via SQLite, handles querries, writes SELECT querries into datastructure.

#Specific purpose:

us2eudatesrename.py: renames filename titles with us to eu date format.

regexcontentsearch.py: searches within files in directories that matches a regular expression. Saves into .txt file.

##To do:

-draft more compact format for regex methods module. (look further to verbose and re.objects)

-add picture file DPI decrease option into copy-move function in writemodules.

-get started on Gui Automation.

-pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx

-implement SQL drivers into inputsql.py.

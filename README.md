Multi-tool scripts for modular use in work.

Aiming for breadth and ease of use enough for similarly positioned business/accountancy professionals like me with basic knowledge of Programming.

Current works:

dirlevel.py: filename pattern search organizing multitool

mcb.py: Saves, loads and deletes pieces of text to the clipboard.

multireader.py: reads pdf, docx, xlsx and any other files, outputs a datastructure in the form of a dictionary with filename...

regexcontentsearch.py: searches within files in directories that matches a regular expression. Saves into .txt file.

-write datastructure to csv, excel, database (excel has import from csv, lookup.)

-read database through sqlite to datastructure..? (wait for datascience course..? Might be ready libraries available...)

-draft more compact format for regex methods module. (look further to verbose and re.objects)

-get started on Sweigart's Gui Automation.
